# LeafLog
Flask-based app with two core sets of functionalities:
- Assist users in taking care of plants, with features such as automated reminders for water and fertilizer, pest and disease identification etc; 
- A gamified component, supposed to be optional and non-intrusive, to encourage consistency in plant care.
This consists of a mock social-media website populated by profiles of the users' plants:
    - Text models can be used to pre-generate a large numberposts, status updates, comment threads and storylines, trying to depict realistic interactions between plants
    - To make interactions (as well as how well a plant is being taken care of) feel impactful and engaging, they can be made to affect a set of 'character' and 'relationship' attributes influencing a plant's future posting
    - To improve interactivity, as well as encouraging consistency, plants could be made to 'DM' users, asking for advice on some question;
    the user could then choose from a list of replies,resulting in different outcomes;
